# Password-Generator

## Week 2 Module 3 Challenge - UCI Bootcamp

This was our third challenge project of our bootcamp. Overall, we were given some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to work with. We were told to create a password generator that allows users to specify what they wanted in their generated password. I first created arrays that included all of the possible characters that could be included in the password and then began writing the JavaScript logic and functions. Overall it was similar to the game logic we used to write our Rock, Paper, Scissors game so it was not overly difficult, but I ran into some problems with concating arrays. I figured out that I needed to set the array to become the new array, and that fixed most of my issues. I then ran into an issue where I added in a "Special Character", "Number", "Lower Case Letter", and/or "Upper Case Letter" depending on the user's inputs to ensure that at least one character of their selection was inputted. However, this made it so that these characters appeared at the beginning of the password, so the order was not random. I tried fixing this myself, but I was not able to create the loop for it, so I did some research and ended up using javascript.info/task/shuffle in order to create a shuffle array function.
